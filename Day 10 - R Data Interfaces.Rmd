# R Data Interfaces

In R, we can read data from files stored outside the R environment. We can also write data into files which will be stored and accessed by the operating system. R can read and write into various file formats like csv, excel, xml etc.


## Getting and Setting the Working Directory

Check which directory the R workspace is pointing to using the `getwd()` function. Set a new working directory using `setwd()` function.

```{r}
# Get and print current working directory.

getwd()

# Set current working directory.

setwd("/cloud/project/Day 10")

# Get and print current working directory.

print(getwd())


```
